## Panel description

Currently there is a deluge of ‘off-piste’ collaborative authoring going on in Open Science, the adoption of: software versioning systems like GitHub for writing; simulations and code in platforms like Jupyter; or in ‘real time’ web authoring ‘operational transformation algorithm’ based software like Etherpad. Yet, the ‘digital plumbing’ of this publishing flood is just not in place. How do we ID these documents or reuse them for example? These questions have been asked and answered before, but are outside the fast moving, forward looking tech world. As an example, Ted Nelson coined the term ‘transclusion’ (Nelson 1987) back in the ‘80s. Transclusion is a step on from the ‘hyperlink’, another Nelson term, where not just the link of a target is included in a document but instead the whole content (AKA live linked embedding). Currently if you want to link and include another document fragment in your document with persistence, it’s unlikely to work. The panelists will explore how this exciting field can better support research.

## Questions

The long list https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/mxuQrhI6kpLu-2FgcI3L6ggf/

Four key issues related to Open Science and collaborative authoring:

 1. Types of collaboration: do these categories capture what is included in collaboration? 

 - Teamwork: analogous, spatially and temporally limited cooperation
 - Collaboration: simultaneous, interactive and purposeful collaboration

https://web.archive.org/web/20151229154133/https://www.namics.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Wissen/2008/Fachartikel/E-Collaboration.pdf 

2. Credit and attribution, how to move beyond one dimensional credit: CRediT https://www.casrai.org/credit.html, roles attribution, transitive credit: Daniel Katz https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5117, what to do about limits on attribution when there are 100s of contributors, sources, and data sources. But how can https://speakerdeck.com/arfon/journal-of-open-source-software-when-collaborative-open-source-meets-peer-review?slide=19

3. When using lots of different tools on the web. Lack of archiving, long term preservation: Using multiple tools across the web and institution don't know what's going on - Scholarly Productivity Portals - free, get functionality but have no archiving: no CLOCKSS https://clockss.org/, LTP - No systematic archiving. An example to solve these issue is https://myresearch.institute/ @mart1nkle1n 

4. Collaboration how is it impacting Open Science areas: Taking into account that there are technical and social (relations) are areas in Open science, e.g.,:
 - Technical
   - OER
   - Open Access
   - Open Data
   - Open Peer Review
   - Open Source
   - etc.
 - Social
   - Code of conduct (inclusion, safe sapces, etc.)
   - Trust in science/scholarship
   - Enabling global south
   - Innovation
   - Social bias and ethics
   - Equality
   - Access for Global South 
   - etc.

### A perspective on future publishing

I am approaching collaborative authoring from the experiences of being the director of a small publishing company. It is these experiences that inform my research of ‘future publishing’. This means caring about the integrity of all parts of a publication and over its complete life and being aware of the hidden labor and skills involved in a publication production.

What is important to Open Science now is to take on board that the transformation to **‘semantic/computational publishing’** is not only desirable/inevitable but it is now happening at an accelerated rate. Finally after 80+ years of the universal machine we can start writing again.

### Open Scholarship/Science: Trust, participation, and sprints

Collaborative authoring is of value generally to Open Science in terms of developing trust in scholarship and science and creating pathways for participation by the public, such as: professional, NGOs, in training, and the general public. The Open Science of 5 years ago is not the Open Science of now and the far-right and governments around the world look to attack institutions of knowledge directly, and so strengthening connections to the outside world are needed even more.

**Sprints** are the example of collaborative authoring I would like to use as they are examples of making a context and a goal for knowledge creation, what I would call **pathways**.

### The flood

Academics are using multiple tools across the web and institution don't know what's going on — **scholarly productivity portals gone wild** — where they get free functionality but with no long term preservation, no systematic archiving, or CLOCKSS and which opens up lots of questions. The systems might be: FigShare, Zenodod, Twitter, SlideShare, Etherpads, GitHub, or Instagram, etc. And yet it is the mandate of national libraries and other institutions to preserve scholarly output.

One example prototype project addresses this issue from Los Alamos National Laboratory is called **The Scholarly Orphans**. The proposal is that institutions archive their members content using web crawlers and this has been shown to work at scale.

### Institutions as service providers

When we look around to see who are the platform or service providers then we see that nearly all collaborative authoring systems are fully FOSS and so can he hosted. Let’s take collaborative real-time writing as the example:

 - CrypPad
 - CodiMD 
 - Etherpad
 - Jupyter Book/Notebook/Binder - with Prosemirror
 - Fidus Writer
 - Dokie.li

If we want to open up scholarship to the wider public then **could libraries or institutions be the hosts for such tools** instead of unstable providers. I say this when there isn’t much interest in market supplier to provide these services or if there is there isn’t a profit to incentivize them.

### Open Science and connected services

In the model of semantic/computational publishing we move beyond platforms and onto connected services, what can be called ‘cloud services’ or ‘microservices’ and this means we have different types of collaboratively authored content.

 - The **literature publication** with a sprint - group collaboration
 - **Linked data** and Wikidata - crowd collaboration
 - And **knowledge graphs** such as the TIB project **Open Research Knowledge Graph** - aggregated collaborations
