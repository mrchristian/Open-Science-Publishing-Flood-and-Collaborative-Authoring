## Panel description

Currently there is a deluge of ‘off-piste’ collaborative authoring going on in Open Science, the adoption of: software versioning systems like GitHub for writing; simulations and code in platforms like Jupyter; or in ‘real time’ web authoring ‘operational transformation algorithm’ based software like Etherpad. Yet, the ‘digital plumbing’ of this publishing flood is just not in place. How do we ID these documents or reuse them for example? These questions have been asked and answered before, but are outside the fast moving, forward looking tech world. As an example, Ted Nelson coined the term ‘transclusion’ (Nelson 1987) back in the ‘80s. Transclusion is a step on from the ‘hyperlink’, another Nelson term, where not just the link of a target is included in a document but instead the whole content (AKA live linked embedding). Currently if you want to link and include another document fragment in your document with persistence, it’s unlikely to work. The panelists will explore how this exciting field can better support research.

## Questions

The long list https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/mxuQrhI6kpLu-2FgcI3L6ggf/

Four key issues related to Open Science and collaborative authoring:

 1. Types of collaboration: do these categories capture what is included in collaboration? 

 - Teamwork: analogous, spatially and temporally limited cooperation
 - Collaboration: simultaneous, interactive and purposeful collaboration

2. Credit and attribution, how to move beyond one dimensional credit: CRediT https://www.casrai.org/credit.html, roles attribution, transitive credit: Daniel Katz https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5117, what to do about limits on attribution when there are 100s of contributors, sources, and data sources. But how can https://speakerdeck.com/arfon/journal-of-open-source-software-when-collaborative-open-source-meets-peer-review?slide=19

3. When using lots of different tools on the web. Lack of archiving, long term preservation: Using multiple tools across the web and institution don't know what's going on - Scholarly Productivity Portals - free, get functionality but have no archiving: no CLOCKSS https://clockss.org/, LTP - No systematic archiving. An example to solve these issue is https://myresearch.institute/ @mart1nkle1n 

4. Collaboration how is it impacting Open Science areas: Taking into account that there are technical and social (relations) are areas in Open science, e.g.,:
 - Technical
   - OER
   - Open Access
   - Open Data
   - Open Peer Review
   - Open Source
   - etc.
 - Social
   - Code of conduct (inclusion, safe sapces, etc.)
   - Trust in science/scholarship
   - Enabling global south
   - Innovation
   - Social bias and ethics
   - Equality
   - Access for Global South 
   - etc.
